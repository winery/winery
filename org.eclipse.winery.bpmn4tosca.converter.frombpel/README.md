# BPEL2BPMN4TOSCA
Converter for transforming a BPEL management process to a BPMN4TOSCA management process

## Code Style
We loosely follow [Google's Style Guide]()https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
We especially follow the [CamelCaseRule](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.3-camel-case):
`BPEL2BPMN4TOSCA` is wrong, `Bpel2Bpmn4Tosca` is correct.

## IDE
Use IntelliJ as Eclipse has issues with `trim_trailing_whitespace = true`.
