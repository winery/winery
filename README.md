Winery is a web-based environment to graphically model TOSCA topologies and plans managing these topologies.
It is an Eclipse project and thus support is available through its project page <https://eclipse.org/winery>.
Winery is also part of the OpenTOSCA ecosystem where more information is available at <http://www.opentosca.org>.

There was no software security check of Eclipse Winery in the past.
There might be [remote code execution vulnerabilities](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec).
